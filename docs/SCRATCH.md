Irelands only VW Syncro 4x4 event! The event consists of not one but two-weekend camping and 4x4 events allowing you time in between to explore Ireland

Eire Syncro was the first ever Syncro event ever held in Ireland. This event was attended by the French Syncro Club and also Club 8090 Syncronauts of which the organisers of Eire Syncro were also members. From what we know there are approximately 16-20 Syncros in total in the whole of Ireland so it was quite amazing to have our ranks swelled to approximately 30 Syncros with our French and English fellow Syncronauts and some members from the Irish VW clubs. The event was held over two weekends the first part on the East by the Second on the West which gave all who attended a week to go exploring in between. We would very much like to repeat this event and this page is to advertise and promote it so we can do this again please enjoy all the amazing photos and videos that were taken by the participants and there are some of my own and please feel free to comment and share. Many 
thanks, Paul



<!-- Fonts -->
Candidates:
Rambla 400
Droid Sans - optimized for smaller screens
Monserrat - good all purpose content font
**Raleway - I like the style of the 'W' - hints of the W in VW logo**


<!-- Colours -->
Colour options:

To highight the 'Irishness' we'll use a green/white/gold variation throughout the site. I chose to base these colours on actual official VW colours as used on the Syncro vans (e.g. VW Escorial Green), so this design choice should also feel familiar to the site's users.  The off-white choice for the background was between a Ford Polar and a Chrysler Arctic White, both of which have AAA WCAG 2.0 contrast scores when used as text on the green background (i.e in the header & footer)

Body:   White,   Ford Polar white    #eef4f4  
Header: Green,   VW Escorial Green   #344d2c
Footer Green
Content text: Green on White; White on Green
Hghlights - Active/Selected/Borders: Gold/Yellow,   VW Brilliant Yellow:    #edda1c

Other suggestions:
VW Bamboo Yellow:       #d78e34     No. too orangey?
VW Pastel White:        #f4f1d6     *maybe  rgb: (244, 241, 214)
Chrysler Arctic White:  #f6f7f4     *maybe. slightly better AAA 8.7
Misc:
Post-It note colour: Pale Canary, #FFFF99, (255, 255, 153)
