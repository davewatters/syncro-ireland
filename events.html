                    went down a treat on the last occasion. We encourage all attendees to take the week
                    between to explore our wonderful country.

                <p>Our Syncronaut friends in the UK never fail to organise a great event,
                    and this year was no exception. We took in the splendour of the Welsh border country.
                    A fantastic time was had by all. We'll share some pictures here soon. A big 'Thank you!' to all involved.

                <h3>Eire Syncro was the first ever Syncro event held in Ireland in 2011</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Eire Syncro was the first ever Syncro event held in Ireland.
                    This event was attended by the French Syncro Club and also Club 8090 Syncronauts
                    of which the organisers of Eire Syncro were also members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From what we know there were approximately 16-20 Syncros in total in the whole of Ireland so it was quite amazing to have our ranks swelled to approximately 30 Syncros with our French and English fellow Syncronauts and some members from the Irish VW clubs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The event was held over two weekends - the first part in the East of the country, and the second in the West, which gave all who attended a week to go exploring in between.
                    We would very much like to repeat this event and this websote has been built to advertise and promote it so that we can do this again. Please enjoy all the amazing photos and videos that were taken by the participants, including some of my own, and please feel free to comment and share
                    on our <a class="inline-link" href="#footer">social media</a> platforms.
