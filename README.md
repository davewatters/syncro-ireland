# Syncro Ireland

## The Home of Ireland's Annual VW Syncro 4x4 Event
Syncro Ireland was built to become the main focal point of an annual Irish event for VW Syncro enthusiasts. The site aims to promote and encourage engagement from the community across the island of Ireland, the UK, and international visitors.  The organisers' goal is to encourge enthusiasts to sign up to receive a newsletter regarding Syncro (and other 4x4) events, and to build a cohort of volunteers to ensure the event's continued success.

## Purpose
This website was created as the first Portfolio Project (PP1) for the Code Institute's Full Stack Web Development course.

The site was built to become the main focal point of an annual Irish event for VW Syncro enthusiasts. The target audience are mostly VW Syncro owners, but extends to all other 4x4, off-roading and camper van enthusists. The organisers had been using various other media to get information out to the channel, for example Facebook or an online club forum, with mixed success. They realised that there was no single online destination to find out about events in Ireland and connect all interested parties. This made it difficult to build momentum for an event idea, and it was realised that a register of volunteers was needed to help make the event happen.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   ### Design Strategy Goals
        1. Create an online presence to promote the annual Irish event
        2. Site must inform vistors about future and past events
        3. Create a registration form to:
            - capture contact details of those interested in receiving a newsletter
            - capture contact details of those interested in volunteering at events
            - allow the user to submit suggestions or feedback 
        4. Site must be intuitive to read & navigate on both desktop & mobile devices

    -   ### Design Scope to Deliver MVP
        -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

            1. I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation
            2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content
            3. I want to find their social media links to follow event news

        -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

            1. I want to be able to easily register my interest in attending an event
            2. I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisers with any questions or suggestions I may have
            3. I want to find community links

        -   #### Frequent User Goals
            1. I want to to see if there are any new events happening
            2. I want to to see if there are any updates on a forthcoming event
            3. I want to see any new photos or videos of previous events or realted acitivites

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        To highight the 'Irishness' of the site a green/white/gold variation was used throughout the site. I chose to base these colours on actual official VW colours as used on the Syncro vans (e.g. VW Escorial Green), so this design choice should also feel familiar to the site's users. Unfortunately, the VW Pastel White didn't quite have enough contrast with the background, so the off-white choice for the background was between a Ford Polar and a Chrysler Arctic White, both of which have 'AAA' WCAG 2.0 contrast scores when used as text on the green background (i.e in the header & footer). The results of the colour colour contrast testing are included in the [Testing](#testing) section below.

        - Colour choices
            - Ford Polar White, #eef4f4  
            - VW Escorial Green, #344d2c
            - VW Brilliant Yellow, #edda1

        - How colours were used
            - Body: White
            - Header: Green 
            - Footer: Green
            - Content text: Green on White or White on Green, as applicable
            - Hghlights (Active/Selected/Border): Yellow


    -   #### Typography
    <!-- choice not yet finalised. Will probably use Raleway as the 'W' bears some resemblance to the W in VW -->
        - Rambla, Montserrat, Raleway, Droid ??

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)

## Credits

### Code

- README.md - The structure was arrived at by examining the Code Institute sample templates and some previous CI users' projects. In particular, the Table of Contents idea came from Daisy McGirr's milestone project [HOTD](https://github.com/Daisy-McG/MilestoneProject-1)

### Content

-   All content created by the site creator [David Watters](https://github.com/davewatters/).
